the script written above will help you to maintain your own customized firewall where you can add some url 
and banned these urls from browsing such that when some one type these urls in the browser then they will get

You will get the option to add the new url to be blocked, to show the list of the urls you have blocked and 
to delete the particular url from being blocked from your browser.
